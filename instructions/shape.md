# Shape

Shaping creates surface tension which will help your loaf rise up in the oven instead of spreading out.

## Instructions

1. **Flour your work surface** lightly. Also flour the bottom 1/3 of the dough.

2. **Gently turn out the dough** onto the surface.

3. **Using a floured benchscraper,tuck flour under the sides of the dough.** Remove any excess flour.

4. **Shape the batard**:
   - Gently lift a side of the dough, pull up and out and fold like a letter
   - Pat the dough down and remove any air pockets for an even crumb
   - Repeat on the other side.
   - Lift the bottom 1/3 of the dough (floured earlier) and start rolling it over itself towards the middle. Gently but firmly use your thumbs to tuck the dough.
   - Seal the sides by pinching
   - Dust the top with flour

6. **Transfer to a floured proofing basket** (banneton), seam side UP.

## Tips

- Don't overwork - each touch degases the dough
- Flour the banneton well to prevent sticking (rice flour works great)
- The dough should feel taut with a smooth surface
