# Fold

This initial fold helps start building gluten structure after mixing.

## Instructions

1. **Wet your hands** to prevent sticking.

2. **Slide your hand down the side** of the bowl and under the dough.

3. **Stretch the dough up** gently until you feel resistance (don't tear it!).

4. **Fold it over** to the center or opposite side.

5. **Rotate the bowl 90°** and repeat.

6. **Complete 4 folds** (one on each "side" of the dough).

7. **Flip the dough** so the seam side is down.

8. **Cover and rest** until the next fold or lamination.


## Tips

- Be gentle but firm - aggressive stretching can tear the gluten
- The dough should feel progressively stronger with each fold session
- If the dough resists stretching, let it rest longer before continuing
