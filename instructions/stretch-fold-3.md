# Fold #3

Final stretch and fold - after this, the dough will rest undisturbed to complete bulk fermentation.

## Instructions

1. **Wet your hands** thoroughly.

2. **Reach under the dough** on one side, all the way to the bottom of the bowl.

3. **Lift the dough up** letting it stretch, then fold it over to the opposite side.

4. **Rotate the bowl 180°** and repeat on the other side.

5. **Rotate 90°** and do two more folds (4 folds total).

6. **Cover and rest** 1.5 hours until the next fold.

## Tips

If making more than 1 loaf, wait only 1 hour, then divide and pre-shape the loaves. Rest for the final 30 minutes and continue as normal. To pre-shape use the benchscraper or your damp hand to push the dough on the surface, creating tension, as you bring it round and into a circle.
