# Lamination

## Instructions

1. **Lightly wet your work surface** or use a thin layer of water.

2. **Transfer the dough** onto the surface.

3. **Gently stretch the dough** into a large, thin rectangle:
   - Work from the center outward
   - Use gravity by lifting edges and letting them stretch
   - Aim for the dough to be almost translucent

4. **Fold into thirds** like a letter (left side over center, right side over left).

5. **Rotate 90°** and fold into thirds again.

6. **Transfer to a Pyrex dish** seam-side down.

7. **Cover and let rest** 45-60 minutes.

## Tips

- The dough should stretch thin without tearing if gluten is well-developed
- Work quickly to prevent the dough from drying out
- This is a great time to add mix-ins by sprinkling them over the stretched dough before folding
