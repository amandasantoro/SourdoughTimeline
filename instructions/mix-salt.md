# Mix in the Salt

Adding salt separately after the levain helps ensure even distribution.

## Instructions

1. **Sprinkle the salt** evenly over the top of your dough.

2. **Use the pinch and fold method** to incorporate:
   - Wet your dominant hand
   - Pinch and lift the dough and fold it over itself
   - Rotate the bowl as you go

3. **Mix until fully incorporated for 4 minutes** - no gritty salt crystals should remain.

4. **Cover and rest** - this begins bulk fermentation.
