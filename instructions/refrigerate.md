# Refrigerate Overnight

Cold retarding develops flavor and makes the dough easier to handle for scoring and baking.

## Instructions

1. **Do the Poke test** to ensure the dough is ready

2. **Cover the proofing basket** with a plastic bag, shower cap, or reusable beeswax wrap or cloth.

3. **Place in the refrigerator** (ideally 38-40°F / 3-4°C).

4. **Proof for 8-16 hours** (overnight is perfect).

5. **Bake directly from fridge** - no need to warm to room temperature!
