# Mix the Levain

Now it's time to incorporate your active sourdough starter (levain) into the autolysed dough.

## Instructions

1. **Check your starter** - make sure it's at peak activity (bubbly, domed, passes float test).

2. **Spread the starter** over the top of your autolysed dough.

3. **Use the stretch and fold method** to incorporate:
   - Wet your dominant hand
   - Pinch and lift the dough and fold it over itself
   - Rotate the bowl as you go

4. **Continue for 4 minutes** until the starter is fully incorporated and no streaks remain.

5. **Cover and rest** for 30 minutes before adding salt.
