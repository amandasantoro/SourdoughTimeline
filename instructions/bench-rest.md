# Bench Rest

## Instructions

1. **Leave the shaped dough** in the banneton to rest on the work surface.

2. **Do NOT cover** - a slight skin forming helps with the final shape.

3. **Rest for 20 minutes** depending on dough readiness.

4. **Check dough with the Poke Test**:
- Poking gently leaves a slight indentation which springs back slowly but does not fully return to the surface.
