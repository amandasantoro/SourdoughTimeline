## Instructions

1. **Measure your flour** into a large mixing bowl:
   - Bread flour
   - Whole wheat flour (if using)

2. **Add the water**

3. **Mix until no dry flour remains** - use your hands or a dough whisk. The dough will be shaggy and rough - that's perfect!

4. **Cover the bowl** with a plate.

5. **Rest** at room temperature.

## Tips

- Keep the dough covered to prevent a skin from forming
